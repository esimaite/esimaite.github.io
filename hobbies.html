  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p> Here is some of my hobbies that I'd like to share with you.</p>
  <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <p>My dream is to one day travel the world. I've already visited<br/>
  a lot of places, but there is still so much left. Here is some of <br/>
  of the pictures from the last summer, when I was traveling in the <br/>
  United States. </p>

  <h2> Photography</h2>
    <p> I was always interested in taking pictures, however <br/>
  I've never gave much effort to it. It was always something<br/>
  that I'd like to do but never did. However, last year I've <br/>
  got an old photo camera Zenit11 from my grandfather and the idea<br/>
  to take pictures in old way seemed much more interesting than<br/>
  to do it digitaly. You never know what you've captured, you can<br/>
  just imagine. Also the time while waiting for the pictures to be <br/>
  made drives me. The moment of receiving the photos is fascinating,<br/>
  even some of them are blured or out of focus it brings a memory<br/>
  from the exact moment you made it. That's why I love it. </p>
