 <h1> About Me</h1>
  <img src="family.jpg" height="400"> 
  <p>Hey everyone, welcome to my personal website. Since you</br>
are here, I will tell you a couple of things about myself and my family.</br></br>
My name is Emilija and I'm a third year student of Contemporary</br>
Communication. I'm originally from Vilnius, which for most of my </br>
friends was a really weird thing that I came to this small abandoned </br>
town to study, when in capital there were many options, as others </br>
would say. However, I've chose not the city but university, and for </br>
that I have no regrets at all.</p>
  <p>Talking about my family, I'm the oldest sister. I have two adorable </br>
siblings, sister and brother, who are 4 and 7 years old respectively. My</br>
brother just started the school this year, and sister, she is still enjoying her </br>
days in the childrengarden. They both are cute and amazing, and I'm</br>
always missing them. </p>
